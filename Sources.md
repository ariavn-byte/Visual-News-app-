Project: Visual News Source - Data & Analysis SourcesPart 1: Data Ingestion Sources (The "What")This category includes sources used for real-time event detection and tracking. They provide the high-volume, high-velocity data that populates the map with hotspots.üåê 1. Trusted News APIsGDELT Project: (Free & Powerful) For broad, automated event detection across global sources.NewsAPI.org: (Free Tier) For targeted, real-time headlines from major outlets.MediaStack: (Free Tier) For coverage of a wide range of global and regional sources.Aylien News API: (Free Trial) For advanced NLP to extract event details automatically.üì± 2. Real-Time OSINT PlatformsX (formerly Twitter): For immediate, on-the-ground reports from journalists and OSINT analysts.Telegram Channels: For raw intelligence and early warnings from conflict zones.Specialized Reddit Communities: For crowdsourced aggregation and initial verification of events.WhatsApp Channels: An emerging platform for broadcast news.Part 2: AI Analytical Corpus (The "Why")This is a curated library of high-credibility, in-depth sources. When an analysis is triggered, the AI will be "grounded" with relevant reports and data from this corpus to ensure its reasoning is transparent, well-researched, and multifaceted.A.
