Project: Visual News SourceOverviewThe Visual News Source is an interactive mapping tool designed for geopolitical analysis. It moves beyond simple news aggregation to visualize the complex web of relationships between events in the Middle East.The core purpose of this tool is to provide a holistic view of regional dynamics, allowing users to see not only what is happening, but to explore the why by revealing the potential interconnections, causal chains, and multifaceted influences that shape events. It is built to serve as an analytical aid for researchers, journalists, and anyone interested in the intricate nature of international relations.Main FeaturesHybrid Visualization (Macro & Micro Views):The map displays news activity on two levels simultaneously. Faint, color-coded country backgrounds provide a macro "temperature check" of average news volume, while bright, distinct circles pinpoint specific local hotspots where major events are occurring.Web of Influence (AI-Powered Analysis Mode):This is the core analytical feature. By clicking "Analyze Connections" on any event, the user triggers a call to the Gemini API. The AI analyzes the primary event and its potential influencing factors, then dynamically draws a "web of influence" on the map.This web uses varied line styles to represent the strength (Strong, Moderate, Weak) of each connection, as determined by the AI's analysis.Depth of Insight (AI-Generated Narrative):When the "Web of Influence" is activated, a modal window appears containing a concise, AI-generated narrative summary. This text explains the overall geopolitical situation and the reasoning behind each connection in the web, providing crucial context and depth.Interactive Hotspots & Popups:Every event on the map is an interactive hotspot. Clicking on one reveals a popup with the specific news item and the button to launch the AI analysis.
