Project: Visual News SourceStatus: In Development‚úÖ Completed FeaturesBasic Interactive Map & UI: Established the core Leaflet map, UI structure, and foundational hotspot functionality.Hybrid View (Country Avg. + City Hotspots): Implemented a dual-layer visualization showing both macro-level country activity (background color) and micro-level city-specific events (hotspot circles).Interconnected Events Visualization (Static Chains): Added the ability to draw persistent connection lines and multi-step chains on the map to represent pre-defined relationships between events.Causality Strength Indicator (Styled Lines): Enhanced connection lines with distinct visual styles (solid/red for strong, dashed/blue for moderate, dotted/gray for weak) to represent the nature and strength of the influence.AI-Powered Analysis for Pre-defined Chains: Integrated the Gemini API to provide on-demand narrative analysis when a user clicks on a pre-defined connection line or chain.üìù Upcoming Features & Implementation Plan1. Compare Two Events Side-by-Side (Next Up)Goal: Allow users to select any two event hotspots to generate a novel, on-the-fly analysis of their potential connection.Prerequisites & Workflow:[Prerequisite] Dynamic Knowledge Base Creation: Before analysis, the system must perform an automated background check.Action: Query a real-time event database (e.g., GDELT Project) for historically and contextually relevant events related to the two selected locations.Output: An "on-the-fly dossier" of recent historical data that will provide context for the AI.[Workflow] Two-Step AI Analysis:Step 1 (Intelligence Gathering): The Gemini API is provided with the two primary events selected by the user, plus the contextual "dossier" of related historical events.Step 2 (Synthesis & Analysis): The AI is prompted to act as a geopolitical analyst, synthesizing the primary events within the context of the dossier to produce the final output.[UI/UX] Output: A modal window featuring a "Likelihood of Connection" score and a detailed narrative explanation.2. "Chain of Events" Timeline GeneratorGoal: Visualize how events unfold over time by showing potential preceding and subsequent events.Implementation Idea: When analyzing an event, trigger AI prompts like "What prior events likely led to this?" and "What might follow?"3. Multiple AI PerspectivesGoal: Allow users to view an analysis through different lenses (e.g., Economic, Humanitarian, Military) to understand bias and complexity.Implementation Idea: Use UI buttons to trigger different, specially crafted prompts to the Gemini API for the same set of events.4. Search & Command BoxGoal: Provide a direct entry point for analysis, allowing users to immediately find events by location or theme without manually searching the map.Implementation Idea:Location Search: User types a city name (e.g., "Ankara"), and the map pans and zooms to that location.Keyword/Theme Search: User types a theme (e.g., "trade policy"), and the map highlights all related event hotspots.5. Source Transparency LayerGoal: Build user trust by showing the provenance of the data for each event.Implementation Idea: Add source logos (e.g., Reuters, BBC) to event popups and include a "View Sources" button linking to the original articles.
